# Shy Jellyfish
By Junior Garcia

<img src="shy_jellyfish.gif">

This program is based on Dan Shiffman's example of creating a flashlight effect using pixel manipulation in processing. I modified his code a bit so as to make the image size bigger and I added an additional interaction that is based on the user's mouse position. When the user's mouse hovers on top of the face of the jellyfish (which is brighter in contrast to the dark pixels thanks to Dan's code), the expression of the jellyfish becomes sad.
