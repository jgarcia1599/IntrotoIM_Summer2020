# Future of Interaction Design
I was assigned to lead a discussion on the Future of Interaction Design based on an <a href="http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/">article</a> by Brett Victor. It was a fun experience where my classmates and I touched on a lot of pivotal aspects about the future of technology, included but not limited to: usability of technologies, the future of UX research, human adaptation to unconventional technologies,the adoption of new technologies in the average person's life, and the physical, social, and economic repercusions of technologies in general. The slides of my presentation can be found in this folder.
